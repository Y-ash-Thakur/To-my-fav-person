I was awkward as hell while taking pictures 😅, didn\u0027t know where to look or what to do, you can clearly see that in the picture 😂… but something shifted that day. I felt more comfortable around you, felt more me 💫.',

We roamed around the mall, did bowling, laughed, talked, ate pizaaa!! and had a great time together, and yeah I wanted to hug you that day but didn\u0027t do it then 🙂. When it came to photos again, still awkward 😂 but way better than before. It felt easy, familiar — like we were getting used to each other\u0027s presence 🧡.',

The moment I saw you, everything felt right again. For the first time, I hugged you 💗. We talked a lot that day, ate pani puri together 🤭, laughed, shared so many things with each other and hugged again before leaving. That day felt special — like something real had begun ✨.',

We enjoyed, played garba, ate noodles 😂 and had the most amazing time together. Couldn\u0027t hug while leaving, but the day was already perfect 🌙💃.',

    description: "When the day finally arrived, I couldn't stop smiling. The moment I reached the place, my heartbeat started racing — I was nervous but so excited to see you after 40 days. And then, when I finally saw you, I just couldn't stop smiling. It was our first meet after confessing our feelings, and honestly I am considering it as our FIRST DATE already 🫶🏻. Just like our first hug, I kissed you for the first time… and honestly, I can't even explain how I felt in that moment. It felt so nice to hold your hands again after so long. We sat, talked, laughed, and ate together — and somehow, time just flew by. Before leaving, I kissed you again on your cheeks, wishing I could've spent a little more time with you. ❤️",

const letterMessage = `My Dear Sweetuuu!!,

So, it's been over 5 months since we first talked, but it feels like I've known you for a really long time. To be honest, I had no idea that things would turn out this way between us. We started as friends, but somewhere along the way, my feelings for you grew into something much deeper — and honestly, I wasn't expecting that at all.

We may not be dating yet, but I feel like we have something really special going on. I've lost count of how many times I think about you in a day — it's definitely more than I can keep track of. You just stay in my mind all the time, and I find myself smiling for no reason whenever I think about you. You won't believe how many times my mom has caught me smiling while doing random stuff 😂 because you're always there!! 🫶🏻.
And I wish it stayes the same. 

Happy Birthday, to my more-than-a-friend Disha!! ❤️`;
